Description: A package for calculating instantaneous unavailabilities of the basic components along with the top event of a fault tree. You provide a fualt tree in terms of its minimal cut sets,
along with reliability and maintainability distribution functions of the basic components. ftaproxim caculates and plots the instantaneous unavailabilities. Methods are derived from
Horton (2002), Lazarova-Molnar and Horton (2003) and Lazarova-Molnar, Niloofar and Barta (2020).
